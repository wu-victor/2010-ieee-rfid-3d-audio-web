An RFID Interface for 3D Audio Web Consumption

https://2010.ieee-rfid.org/presentations/

## Abstract

We propose a novel multi-stream audio web consumption system using a passive UHF RFID interface. For example, in an eyes-free setting such as an in-vehicle audio system, the left speaker quietly streams the subject lines of a userâ€™s unread emails. Simultaneously, the user chats through a VOIP (voice over Internet protocol) connection via a microphone and the right speaker. On a dedicated surface on the vehicle dashboard, several RFID tags are attached, where an interrogator scans for tags. When it is safe to do so, the user rearranges the tags (possibly removing or adding tags), creating a new session where she can consume other web content in 3D audio space. In another scenario, a user consumes multi-stream audio web content via a mobile device. She uses an integrated interrogator in the device to scan NFC (near field communication) tags, customizing her web consumption experience. The NFC tags may be part of smart posters or displays, or might be even carried by the user herself.
